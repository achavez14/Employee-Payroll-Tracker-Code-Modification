# Employee-Payroll-Tracker-Code-Modification

## Description

-This code was modified to create an application that would allow a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data.
-I was able to learn how to use the code's functions to gather data via prompts and store it in an array of objects, compute and show the average salary, select and display a random employee from the array, sort the employees by last name and present the sorted data in an HTML table.

## Usage

This browser-based application will feature the modifications made to the JavaScript code, which has dynamically changed the HTML and CSS.

Once you have accessed the application titled Employee Payroll Tracker, you will be prompted to enter the employee's first name, last name and salary. After having entered the employee information (the number of employees of your choosing), you will be able to view and manage employee payroll data.
